# ADR-001: Theme Management and User Interface Customization Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

The Naebak platform serves diverse users including citizens, candidates, and government officials who may have different accessibility needs, visual preferences, and usage contexts. We needed to design a system that could provide personalized user interface experiences while maintaining consistency, supporting accessibility requirements, and enabling efficient theme management. Several approaches were considered, including client-side theme storage, database-based preferences, and centralized theme services.

**Decision:**

We have decided to implement a centralized theme service using Redis for fast preference storage, supporting multiple theme variants with comprehensive customization options and accessibility features.

## **Core Architecture Design:**

**Centralized Theme Management** provides a single source of truth for user interface customization across all platform applications. The service manages theme preferences, configuration data, and provides APIs for theme discovery and application.

**Redis-Based Storage** enables fast retrieval of user theme preferences with minimal latency impact on application loading. User preferences are stored as JSON objects with efficient key-based access patterns.

**Multi-Variant Theme Support** accommodates different user needs through specialized theme variants including light/dark modes, high contrast options, and accessibility-enhanced themes.

## **Theme Architecture:**

**Hierarchical Theme Structure** organizes themes into categories with inheritance and override capabilities. Base themes provide foundational styling while variant themes modify specific aspects for different use cases.

**Component-Based Styling** defines themes through reusable component specifications that can be applied consistently across different frontend applications. This approach ensures visual consistency while enabling customization.

**Dynamic Theme Switching** supports real-time theme changes without requiring page reloads or application restarts. Theme preferences are applied immediately and persisted for future sessions.

## **User Experience Features:**

**Preference Persistence** maintains user theme selections across sessions and devices through centralized storage. Users don't need to reconfigure their preferences when accessing the platform from different locations.

**Theme Preview System** enables users to preview themes before applying them, providing visual feedback about color schemes, typography, and component styling. This reduces trial-and-error in theme selection.

**Accessibility Integration** includes specialized themes for users with visual impairments, motor disabilities, or other accessibility needs. High contrast themes, large text options, and reduced motion variants are supported.

## **Performance and Scalability:**

**Fast Preference Retrieval** uses Redis caching to minimize theme loading times during user session initialization. Theme data is retrieved in a single operation without database queries.

**Efficient Theme Distribution** provides theme configuration data through lightweight JSON responses that can be cached by client applications. This reduces bandwidth usage and improves loading performance.

**Horizontal Scaling** supports multiple theme service instances sharing the same Redis backend, enabling load distribution and high availability for theme operations.

## **Theme Variants and Customization:**

**Standard Theme Collection** includes light, dark, and high contrast variants that cover the majority of user preferences and accessibility requirements. Each theme is carefully designed for optimal readability and usability.

**Brand-Specific Themes** support platform branding and government styling requirements through specialized theme variants. These themes maintain accessibility while incorporating official color schemes and typography.

**Custom Theme Support** enables advanced users and administrators to create custom theme variants with specific color schemes, typography choices, and component styling modifications.

## **Integration and Compatibility:**

**Frontend Framework Integration** provides theme data in formats compatible with popular CSS frameworks and component libraries. Themes can be applied to React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JavaScript applications.

**CSS Variable Generation** converts theme configurations into CSS custom properties that can be dynamically applied to stylesheets. This approach enables efficient theme switching without stylesheet recompilation.

**Component Library Support** ensures themes work seamlessly with design system components and UI libraries used across the platform. Theme specifications include component-specific styling rules.

## **Accessibility and Compliance:**

**WCAG Compliance** ensures all theme variants meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for color contrast, text readability, and interactive element visibility. Accessibility features are built into the theme system rather than added as afterthoughts.

**Screen Reader Optimization** includes theme variants optimized for screen reader users with appropriate color choices and contrast ratios that don't interfere with assistive technology.

**Motor Accessibility** supports users with motor impairments through themes with larger interactive targets, increased spacing, and reduced precision requirements for interface interactions.

## **Configuration and Management:**

**Theme Configuration API** provides administrative interfaces for managing available themes, updating theme specifications, and monitoring theme usage across the platform.

**Usage Analytics** tracks theme adoption and user preferences to inform future theme development and identify accessibility gaps or user experience issues.

**Version Management** supports theme versioning and migration to enable theme updates without breaking existing user preferences or application compatibility.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **User Experience**: Personalized themes improve user satisfaction and accessibility, making the platform more inclusive and user-friendly.
*   **Performance**: Redis-based storage provides fast theme retrieval with minimal impact on application loading times.
*   **Consistency**: Centralized theme management ensures visual consistency across all platform applications while enabling customization.
*   **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features and specialized themes support users with diverse needs and comply with accessibility standards.
*   **Maintainability**: Centralized theme configuration simplifies updates and ensures changes are applied consistently across the platform.

**Negative:**

*   **Dependency**: Applications become dependent on the theme service for styling information, creating a potential single point of failure.
*   **Complexity**: Theme management adds complexity to the frontend development process and requires coordination between design and development teams.
*   **Storage Requirements**: Redis storage requirements grow with user base, though theme data is relatively small per user.

**Implementation Notes:**

The current implementation prioritizes user experience and accessibility over advanced customization features. Future enhancements could include user-generated themes, advanced color palette customization, and integration with external design tools. The modular architecture allows for these improvements without major changes to the core theme management system while maintaining the benefits of centralized, fast, and accessible theme delivery.
